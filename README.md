# Computer Vision
- Unclass: Week of 2016-12-19
- Jeremy W. Sherman

This repo is a dumping ground for notes taken during a week of studying computer vision. The initial charter for the week is the (private) [Unclass Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13MCtXiMF2NgKTjGpvNBzbgVnCuvsAP6-9niB_LAs9U0/).

The main practical driver is working through Joseph Howse's *OpenCV for Secret Agents.*

This file in particular is a daily log of notes and daily summaries.
